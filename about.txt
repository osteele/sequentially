I've been doing a lot of client/server/server programming lately.  That is, the
client talks to one server (the application server --- it's the one that manages
sessions and the db), but it also talks to my content network, and this is
effectively a server --- it's the client that is in charge of asking the app server
to update the content network (which it does by using SQS to post a processing
request to yet another server, but that's another story...)
